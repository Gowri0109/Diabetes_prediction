# Diabetes_prediction</br>

**Overview**

This repository contains a Diabetes Prediction project that utilizes Machine Learning to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on input health parameters. The model is trained on a dataset containing various medical attributes and applies classification techniques to determine the presence of diabetes.

**Features**

Data preprocessing and feature selection

Implementation of machine learning algorithms for classification

Model evaluation and performance metrics

Web application interface for predictions (if applicable)

**Dataset**

The dataset used in this project contains medical parameters such as:

Age

BMI (Body Mass Index)

Blood pressure

Glucose levels

Insulin levels

Skin thickness

Diabetes pedigree function

**Technologies Used**

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

NumPy

Pandas

Scikit-Learn

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Flask (if a web interface is included)

Jupyter Notebook for model training and evaluation

**Installation**

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

**Clone the repository:**

git clone https://github.com/Gowri0109/Diabetes_prediction.git

**Navigate to the project directory:**

'cd Diabetes_prediction

**Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

'''python
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For MacOS/Linux</br>
venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows

**Install dependencies:**

'''python
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Jupyter Notebook for model training and evaluation:

jupyter notebook

**Usage**

Run the notebook to train and evaluate the model.

If a web interface is implemented, start the Flask app with:

'''python 
app.py

Input the required parameters and get predictions for diabetes.

**Model Performance**

The model performance is evaluated using:

Accuracy Score

Confusion Matrix

Precision, Recall, and F1-score

ROC Curve and AUC Score
